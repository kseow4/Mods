New Items: 
Legendary Weapons!
Each "Class" has atleast one Legendary weapon which is very rare, but very powerful! (still balanced out though. e.g. the legendary knife does like 10-15 damage more than the machete)
No recipes!
Loot only, similar to MMO's where you had to find the good stuff, y'know.
